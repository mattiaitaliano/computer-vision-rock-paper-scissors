## Model and how to use it

Thanks to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ I teached how to recognize 4 different images: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing.

This will be usefull to let the webcam recognize the sign I'll do to interact with the program and let the computer be aware if it is Rock, Paper, Scissors or Nothing and store it as an input. Thanks to this, I'll be able to run the game and play it through my webcam.

In fact, after I store this input into variables, I can run the program as if I got it by digit them from keybord as we usually do in classic software.
